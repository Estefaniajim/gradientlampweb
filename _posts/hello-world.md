To create a lamp that could visually represent different weather conditions, we explored techniques that combine light, color, and material behavior. Our design process led us to study polarized light mosaics and the Polagons fabrication method, which uses birefringent materials to produce controlled color-changing effects. These ideas helped us develop a mechanism that brings our weather-inspired lamp to life through dynamic gradients and shifting tones.

## Mechanism Behind the Lamp

The internal mechanism of our lamp is inspired by the Polagons technique, a fabrication method that uses polarized light mosaics (PLMs) to create dynamic, color-changing visuals. Our goal was to adapt this concept into a functional, weather-themed lamp that shifts its appearance depending on the time of day or the selected weather state.

INLINE_IMAGES_HERE("PLMs are made from stacking one or more pieces of clear cellophane together and sandwiching them between two polarizers. One can create multicolored designs by arranging stacks of different thicknesses.")

To achieve this, we first studied how Polagons work. Cellophane layers, which are naturally birefringent materials, produce vivid colors when placed between two polarizing filters. As polarized light passes through stacked sheets, the observed color changes based on the material thickness, strain direction, and the angle of the polarizers. This principle allowed us to intentionally design color transitions that represent daytime, nighttime, and rainy weather moods.

We began our process by experimenting with birefringent materials and analyzing how light refracted through angled acrylic pieces. We sketched early lamp concepts that could hold different polarized mosaics on separate faces, each corresponding to a different weather condition. From there, we created test mosaics to explore color palettes, layering techniques, and the interaction between polarizer film and colored cellophane. These studies helped us understand how to control gradients, saturation, and smooth transitions.

Mechanically, the lamp works by placing each mosaic between a fixed polarizer at the back and a rotating polarizer at the front. When the user rotates the polarizing filter, or when the internal mechanism rotates it, the color composition of the mosaic shifts. This gradual transformation produces a smooth visual transition that mimics the movement of light in the sky. Warm tones represent daytime, deep blues represent night, and cooler diffused tones represent rainy weather. The wooden exterior with Talavera-inspired engravings frames these effects and connects the optical mechanism to a traditional aesthetic.

Our design is informed by the research presented in Polagons: [Designing and Fabricating Polarized Light Mosaics with User-Defined Color-Changing Behaviors from the MIT CSAIL HCI group](https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/research/polagons/polagons.html). Their work formalizes how birefringence, layered cellophane, and polarizer orientations can be combined to create controlled color-changing mosaics. While our lamp is a simplified version, the paper guided our understanding of the physics behind polarized light and helped us translate those principles into a functional and expressive object.

In summary, the lamp combines optical science with handcrafted design. It uses stacked cellophane mosaics, strategically positioned polarizers, and a rotating interface to bring different weather conditions to life through shifting color and light.
