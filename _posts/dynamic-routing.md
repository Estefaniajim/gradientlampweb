Seattle’s winter season brings low light, heavy clouds, and long periods of gloomy weather. As newcomers, we noticed how this affects mood, energy, and daily motivation. Indoor spaces often feel dull and monochromatic, especially during the darker months.
We wanted to design an emotional object that brings color, warmth, and visual variety into a room. Instead of a standard lamp, we explored light as a changing mosaic that reflects the environment.

## The design behind

This lamp combines traditional craftsmanship with a dynamic color-changing light experience. Its outer structure features wooden walls engraved with patterns inspired by Talavera, a vibrant and iconic style of Mexican and Spanish ceramic art. The patterned wood allows warm, intricate light projections to spill into the room, giving the lamp both cultural character and functional beauty.

Inside the lamp, a solar powered bulb illuminates a series of interchangeable Polagon mosaics. These mosaics use small acrylic polygons arranged in a way that refracts and filters the light into shifting colors. We explored several approaches for creating color changing effects before selecting the Polagon mosaic technique because it creates rich, layered visuals.

The lamp contains three internal elements:

- **Day disk:** A mosaic with bright, warm tones that evoke sunlight and daytime skies
- **Night disk:** A cooler, darker mosaic that reflects the calm ambience of night time.  
- **Weather mask:** A layered piece with a cloud and rain motif that alters the light to represent rainy conditions.

At the top of the lamp, there is a 3D printed cover designed to be translucent. This cover softens and diffuses the solar light, allowing a gentle glow to pass upward while complementing the changing colors inside the lamp.

The user can rotate or insert the different disks and the weather mask to transform the lamp’s internal scene. This allows the light to shift according to the time of day or the weather.

The final result is a culturally inspired and interactive lamp that blends Talavera influenced design with atmospheric lighting.
