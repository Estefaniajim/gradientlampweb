Throughout this project, we went through several rounds of exploration, prototyping, and refinement. Each stage presented its own successes and challenges, helping us better understand both the Polagons technique and the practical constraints of building a functional lamp. Below is a detailed reflection on each iteration and what we learned from it.

## Iteration 1: Early Sketches and Concept Exploration

In the first round, we created quick sketches to explore how polarized mosaics could be incorporated into a lamp structure. We experimented with color palettes that represented day, night, and rainy weather. This phase helped us translate atmospheric conditions into shapes and tones and taught us how important it was for each face of the lamp to communicate a clear visual theme.

## Iteration 2: Color and Material Tests

Next, we produced small test mosaics by layering different types of cellophane. Here we observed how subtle changes in stacking, orientation, and thickness influenced the final color. We also tested how the polarizer film interacted with the mosaics. These tests revealed that some colors washed out under certain rotations, which helped us refine our palette and better understand the limits of the materials.

## Iteration 3: Laser-Cut Acrylic Disks and Panels

We then laser-cut acrylic disks and flat panels to hold the cellophane layers. We also drew the mosaic designs using Inkscape. This iteration allowed us to experiment with the physical structure of the mosaics. We learned that precise cutting was essential because even small misalignments could disrupt the color transitions. This stage also highlighted how fragile the thin cellophane sheets can be, which forced us to adjust our handling and layering techniques.

## Iteration 4: 3D-Printed Components

After refining the mosaic structure, we prototyped the bottom and back pieces using translucent filament. This material created a soft diffusion effect that improved the overall glow of the lamp. We also designed and 3D-printed a top cover using the same filament. This iteration taught us how filament translucency, print thickness, and patterning influence the quality of the emitted light.
The original design included Talavera-inspired patterns on the 3D-printed faces, but the details were too fine to print accurately. Because of this, we decided to use laser-cut wooden faces instead and only kept the 3D-printed top component. Here is the 360 model.

## Iteration 5: Laser-Cut Wooden Faces

We created the outer wooden frame of the lamp using laser-cut panels engraved with Talavera-inspired patterns. One challenge was ensuring that the wooden panels aligned perfectly with the 3D-printed top cover, which required several adjustments to the vector files.


## Iteration 6: Assembly and Final Adjustments
Finally, we assembled all components and carried out the last round of testing. This included verifying the alignment of the polarizers, checking that the mosaics produced the intended gradients, and making sure the light diffused evenly. During this phase we discovered small issues with panel fit and light leakage, which we corrected by sanding edges and adding additional diffusion layers where needed.
